# Intro

We want teachers to be empowered. This page is a place to collect materials and wisdom for jump-starting teachers, as well as planning the specifics of training parties.

At the moment, we are finalizing exactly how we think this should all work. If you have any ideas, dear Collective, email <collective@austinfreeskool.org>!

# Some generally useful information

## How to start a lesson plan

Ask yourself how to complete the following statement:

> At the end of this class, *students will be able to* ...

The completions should start with a concrete verb. **Make**, **show**, **explain**, **talk about** are all good ones.

**Understand** and **know** are, counterintuitively, somewhat poor choices. You *want* students to understand, but they must *demonstrate* this in a concrete way.

## How to find a space.

Here there ~~should be~~ will be a directory of spaces and contact information.
