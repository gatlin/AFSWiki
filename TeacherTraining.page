# Intro

We want teachers to be empowered. This page will have suggestions for what to do during such sessions. Below are some simple starter ideas.

## How to start a lesson plan

Ask yourself how to complete the following statement:

> At the end of this class, *students will be able to* ...

The completions should start with a concrete verb. **Make**, **show**, **explain**, **talk about** are all good ones.

**Understand** and **know** are, counterintuitively, somewhat poor choices. You *want* students to understand, but they must *demonstrate* this in a concrete way.

## How to find a space.

Here there ~~should be~~ will be a directory of spaces and contact information.
