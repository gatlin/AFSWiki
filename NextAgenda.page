...

Collective members, email <collective@austinfreeskool.org> to add items to the agenda! They'll end up here, I (secretary) promise!

# 10 March 2013

1. Class proposals
2. Reports
3. Integrating teacher training as a core function of the meetings.
4. Ask teachers to attend a couple of classes before proposing one of their own.
5. Ask for an experienced collective member to audit each new class (volunteer basis) and give pointers at the next collective meeting.
6. use ed talks as a way to promote our indiegogo on-line fundraising campaign  (which could be a more successful fundraiser than a party)
